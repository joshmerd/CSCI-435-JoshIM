Comments regarding design: This program was designed to be a demonstration of a TCP chat server. While the actual chatting portion isnâ€™t fully functional, the idea was to show how multiple users can connect to a server and send packets. To run the program, use the following instructions:

## Running the Executables:

### To start TCP Server:
```
1. Run TCPserver_multiple.exe located in the TCP_multiple\TCP_multiple\bin\Debug\ folder.
```

### To start JoshIM clients:
```
1. Run JoshIM.exe located in the JoshIM\JoshIM\bin\Debug\ folder.
```
## Compiling Code:
You may use your choice of C# compilers, such as [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/). 

```
1. In Visual Studio, open TCP_multiple\TCP_multiple\Program.cs
2. Compile and run the code.
3. Open JoshIM\JoshIM\BuddyList.cs to start the first chat sign-in window.
```
